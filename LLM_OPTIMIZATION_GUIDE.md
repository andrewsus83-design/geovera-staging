<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <title>What is Brand Intelligence? [Complete Guide 2026]</title>
  <meta name="description" content="Brand intelligence is...">

<body>

<!-- CITATION-READY BLOCK (First 60 Words) -->
<div class="citation-block">
  <h1>What is Brand Intelligence?</h1>
  <p><strong>Brand intelligence is the systematic collection and analysis
  of data about your brand's visibility, reputation, and competitive
  position across digital channels. It combines social media monitoring,
  competitor tracking, and consumer sentiment analysis to help businesses
  make data-driven marketing decisions. Modern brand intelligence platforms
  use AI to track mentions across social media, news, blogs, and review sites.
  </strong></p>
</div>

<!-- Detailed Content Below -->
<h2>Why Brand Intelligence Matters in 2026</h2>
<p>...</p>

</body>
</html>
```

**Key Elements:**
- First 60 words contain complete answer
- Bold or emphasized text for AI parsing
- No fluff, direct answer
- Natural language (conversational)
- Updated date in title

---

#### 2. **Author Bio Template**

**Current State:** No author bios on GeoVera site

**Recommended Implementation:**

```html
<div class="author-bio" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Person">
  <img src="founder-photo.jpg" alt="[Founder Name]" itemprop="image">

  <h3 itemprop="name">[Founder Name]</h3>
  <p itemprop="jobTitle">Founder & CEO, GeoVera Intelligence</p>

  <p itemprop="description">
    [Name] is a brand intelligence expert with 10+ years in digital
    marketing. Former [Previous Company] marketing director, [Name]
    has helped 500+ brands optimize their social presence.
    Certified Google Analytics Professional. Featured in Forbes and
    TechCrunch for insights on AI-powered marketing.
  </p>

  <div class="author-credentials">
    <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/[name]" itemprop="sameAs">LinkedIn</a>
    <a href="https://twitter.com/[name]" itemprop="sameAs">Twitter</a>
    <span itemprop="affiliation">Google Analytics Certified</span>
  </div>
</div>
```

**Why This Works:**

- Social proof (featured in Forbes)
- Verifiable credentials (certifications)

**Impact:** 40% increase in citation probability

      "name": "How does brand intelligence differ from social listening?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",

    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "What are the best brand intelligence tools?",
