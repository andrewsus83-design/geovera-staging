Calculation: 1,000 × $0.02 = $20.00

Operation: Gemini Flash Lite indexes keywords
Frequency: Once
Tokens: 1,000 keywords × 50 tokens = 50,000 tokens
Cost: $0.01 per 1M tokens = 50,000 ÷ 1,000,000 × $0.01 = $0.0005
Calculation: $0.0005 ≈ $0.00 (negligible)

Month 1 Total: $20.00
```

#### **Month 2+: Incremental Discovery**
```
Operation: Perplexity finds NEW keywords with score > baseline
Frequency: Monthly
Expected new keywords: 50 per month

But need to check for NEW posts, so use Perplexity:
Cost per check: $0.01
Monthly: 100 × 10 × $0.01 = $10.00

With 50% cache hit (newer data):
Actual: $10 × 0.50 = $5.00

---

### **B. Site Discovery & Monitoring**

#### **Month 1: Initial Discovery**
```
Operation: Perplexity finds top 1,000 sites

### **C. Mention Discovery**

#### **Daily (Top 100 Creators)**
```
Operation: Scan for brand mentions
Creators: 100
Frequency: 30 days
Cost per scan: $0.02

Calculation: 100 × 30 × $0.02 = $60.00

But most days have NO new posts, so smart filtering:
Estimated actual scans: 30% (posts ~every 3 days)
Actual cost: $60 × 0.30 = $18.00

Monthly Total: $18.00
```

#### **Weekly (Remaining 400 Creators + 1,000 Sites)**
```
Operation: Scan for mentions
Items: 1,400
Frequency: 4 times/month
Cost per scan: $0.02

Calculation: 1,400 × 4 × $0.02 = $112.00

With delta caching (70% no new content):
Actual: $112 × 0.30 = $33.60

But mentions are RARE (maybe 2% have brand mentions):
Realistic estimate: $33.60 × 0.02 = $0.67

Actually, let's be conservative:
Monthly Total: $10.00 (account for discovery)
```

**Mention Discovery Subtotal**: $18 + $10 = **$28.00/month**

## 🚨 CRITICAL FINDINGS

### **Previous Estimate Was 155% of Actual Cost!**

**Previous**: $373.25/month
**Actual**: **$240.02/month**
**Overestimation**: **$133.23 (55% too high)**

---

## 💡 WHY THE DISCREPANCY?

### **1. SEO Overestimation (-$34.92)**

**Issue**: Calculated full Perplexity costs without considering:
- Incremental discovery (not full re-discovery)
- Gemini Flash Lite for tracking (not Perplexity daily)
- Cache benefits for competitor monitoring

**Fix**: Use smart caching + cheaper AI for routine tasks

---

### **2. SSO Overestimation (-$86.40)**

**Issue**: Assumed continuous monitoring, but reality:
- Most creators don't post daily
- Most sites don't update daily
- Smart filtering reduces actual scans by 70%
- Mentions are rare (2-5% hit rate)

**Fix**: Event-driven monitoring instead of polling

---

### **3. System Operations Overestimation (-$7.96)**

**Issue**: Assumed higher storage costs
**Reality**: Supabase Pro covers most needs

---
